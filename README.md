> I decided to switch to [my fork](https://github.com/andreoliwa/logseq-go) of [logseq-go](https://github.com/aholstenson/logseq-go) because it's more complete and has a better API, while this Rust crate is in alpha.

If you wish to contribute improving this project, please send a pull request.

After having used `logseq-go`, I would wish that this Rust crate could have a similar API.
